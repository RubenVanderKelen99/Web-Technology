The quantum world is very strange and unintuitive. The tools and techniques developed by scientists to probe and understand phenomena such as wave-particle duality and quantum entanglement have spawned new technologies. 

Some technologies, such as quantum cryptography or quantum computing, rely on the direct manipulation of quantum states. In other cases the technology is the product of experiments that continually drive the refinement of lasers, sensors and other imaging devices.

Scope for collaboration
Aberdeen has world-leading academics pursuing fascinating research across the broad scope of quantum-inspired science and technology. 

Research in theoretical and experimental optics inspires the possibilities of quantum information and communication.
The James Watt Nanofabrication Centre makes devices and sensors at an unprecendentedly small scale and holds the key to the miniturisation and application of quantum systems.
Scientists at the Institute of Gravitational Research are discovering more about measurement at the quantum limit through the development of gravitational wave detectors. 
Computing scientists simulate and analyse ways to programme quantum computers.
